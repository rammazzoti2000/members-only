<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project consists of using the [Devise gem](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise) to have a first approach at authentication in rails. It is an application that allows users to create posts, which then the authors of the posts are displayed only if, you as a User, are logged in.
